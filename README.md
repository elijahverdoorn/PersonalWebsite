# Personal Website

My personal site serves a few different purposes - first, it is a digital resume. I am always looking for new opportunities, so having a place for others to go to find me is important. Second, it is a blog; although not always a programming/engineering/tech blog. I tend to write when I feel like it, about whatever I'm thinking about at the time. Finally, it is a cool place for me to mess around with different web development technologies and learn more about hosting something like this on my own.

## Resources

Originally, this was just a static site built by hand using bootstrap. Since then, I've transitioned it to use Hexo on Node.js, which makes it much more suitable for blogging.
