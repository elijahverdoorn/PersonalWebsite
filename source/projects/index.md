# Keep Score

Keep Score is a Actions on Google & DialogFlow project that began as a hackathon exploration of the capabilities of the Actions platform. In just three days I implemented an agent that demonstrated the basics of conversation; expansion of these capabilities over time became a side project that has been important in keeping my JavaScript skills sharp. Code for this project can be found on my GitHub.

# All About Olaf

Development on All About Olaf began about a year before I took over the project, but I quickly realized that the native iOS application needed a complete rewrite. The first move I made to meet the deadline presented of September 2016 after beginning the project in May of the same year was to adopt React Native, enabling rapid cross-platform native development for both iOS and Android using JavaScript. From there, the application's development was a learning experience into the React ecosystem, which I have remained interested in. Still being updated after an on-time release, the application is open-source and has been installed by 50% of the students on St. Olaf's campus. 

# Oleville

Oleville is the website of the St. Olaf College Student Government Association, and it's development was a large part of my college career. I joined the team of developers building the site in my first semester at St. Olaf, and during my junior year had the honor of leading that team as the Chief Technology Officer. Oleville is built on WordPress, and uses a custom theme developed in-house for maximum flexibility. Management of the site has given me exposure into release management, database management, system administration, and user education.

### Members

Members is a plugin developed for Oleville that allows administrators to feature all the members of their organization on Oleville. As my first exposure to plugin development, this process taught me about the basics of WordPress, database usage, and the PHP programming language.

### Voting

The Voting plugin was built to facilitate the need for a robust system with which to manage student government elections. The plugin was my first experience integrating LDAP for user login, and has been modified heavily since the first iteration, which was put into practice on the spring of 2015. Development and maintenance of this plugin gave me the opportunity to reflect numerous times on the code that I had written in the past and make improvements, which has been a good chance to right past mistakes and become deeply familiar with not only the code but also the problem area.

# Web Rendering of 3D Models

During January 2016 I led a team of undergraduates in a research project that focused on devising novel ways to render complex 3D models on the web. This application is a part of a set of larger research that aims to create a 3D model of the interior of the science center on my campus from nothing but a set of images, no measurements allowed. The constraints given present unique challenges that enable student exploration of areas of computing that might not be traditionally taught in the classroom. Companion projects included color correction, semantic segmentation of small image datasets, and stereoscopic rendering.

# Turing Machine Simulator

As a final project for my Theory of Computation class, I built a simple simulator of turing machines using JavaScript. The application was developed quickly, but was successful and demonstrated my ability to develop on the web in an academic setting.
