title: Why Watching Movies is one of my goals in 2021

How many times have you scrolled through Netflix, looking at the myriad of titles served to you only to find yourself watching the same thing that you watched last week? How many times do you think that you've watched _The Office_? Have you sat down to watch that new blu-ray that you got for Christmas yet? If you're like me, your watch list grows every week and never seems to be consumed. This might be because you're busy: that's totally understandable, and even a good thing! I've often found myself too busy to sit down and watch anything, but that situation is just one of the reasons that watching a new movie every month might just be the hardest goal that I set for myself in 2021.

Some people hate "New Years Resolutions", others love them: I tend to stand somewhere in the middle, liking the concept of taking time periodically to take stock of where I'm at, where I want to be, and any changes that I can make to my habits, routines, and life overall to push me along the road towards my goals. I don't think that there is anything special about doing this self-analysis at the start of a new calendar year, but for me it has always felt right (conveniently, I usually have a bit of extra time around the new year to invest in this process). While I am well aware that this kind of analysis and review can (and should) look different for each individual, I enjoy learning about what others do in their process, stealing bits and pieces in order to improve and further develop my own. For this reason, hoping that it'll benefit someone, I'll share how I went about setting up my 2021 goals.

Before I could embark on establishing new goals, I chose to first look back at 2020's goals and see how I'd done in achieving them. Throughout the past year I'd been consistent with checking in on my progress and recording the steps that I'd taken towards achieving them, so for most goals this didn't take much time, nor were the conclusions that I drew very surprising. For goals that had numeric measures of success I just needed to determine if I'd met the mark or not (and note any reasons why or why not), for more abstract goals I took a few minutes to write out a bulleted reflection of what went well towards the goal, what obstacles I had to address in working towards the goal, and a rough measure of my success. In doing this look-back I was able to determine which of my 2020 goals I wanted to carry forward into 2021, which I wanted to modify, and which I would be best off dropping entirely. Starting with the carry-overs I began working to pinpoint what my 2021 goals would be in six broad categories: business, physical fitness, mental growth, spirituality, social engagement, and personal finance. I find it helpful to categorize goals into these different focus areas, although many of the sub-goals could easily fit into more than one of these categories.

I find it much easier to identify goals in some of these areas than others. Business goals typically include career growth, professional networking, and personal project completion. Physical fitness goals are a dime a dozen, mine are not typically all that creative. Personal finance goals are along the lines of saving, investing, and learning more about financial systems. This year I believe that my social engagement goals of staying connected to friends and family will be especially important given the ever-shifting social landscape, I'm going to do this by writing physical letters, sending texts, and meeting up with people in a responsible manner when the conditions allow. I'm happy to say that my spirituality goals are really important to me, but also highly personal; I believe that spiritual growth is important for everyone. After setting all these goals I was left with mental growth: this is typically the area in which I struggle most to set goals.

Mental growth means something different to everyone. In 2020 one of my mental goals was to maintain a journal: I did well on this, believe that it benefited me greatly, and plan to continue the habit. One common mental goal that many set around the new year is to read more, I share this goal in 2021 and have decided to read at least an hour a week. It's a low bar for success, but a big improvement over what I've been doing lately! A third goal that I've set for myself is to engage with and explore new hobbies: I want to discover new passions and activities to be excited about. All three of these goals are inspired by others and far from unique, it's my fourth and final mental goal that I've never heard of anyone else setting: I've made it my goal to watch a *new* movie every month.

This goal is multi-faceted and requires explanation:

- I want to remain culturally aware. I found too often in the past that I missed out on opportunities to enjoy discussion and debate with friends on movies because I'd not seen the content in question.

- Forcing myself to watch a new movie every month combats a "scarcity mindset" that I feel doesn't serve me. I don't expect to ever run out of content that I'm interested in watching; being nervous about such a situation is not founded in reality

- Far too often I find myself 'saving' the viewing of movies (or shows) that I'm really excited for "the perfect moment". The problem with this habit is that I've noticed that the perfect time never comes: I always find a reason that there would be a better time. Continuously searching for this perfect time doesn't ever produce the ideal moment of relaxation that I'm looking for, rather I just deprive myself of seeing the things that I'm excited about in favor of re-watching the same few things over and over again.

- Watching something new takes more effort than re-watching something that I've seen before, but is always more rewarding. I learn more and enjoy myself more when I expose myself to new content rather than looking for new meaning in the same few works.
