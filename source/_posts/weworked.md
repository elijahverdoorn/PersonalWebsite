I'm getting ready to tell my story: the skills that I have, the value that these capabilities can provide, and the path that led me to having these skills. In interviews I know that it's important to be able to succinctly deliver a compelling message that makes corporate representatives excited about taking the next step forward and giving me the chance to demonstrate my skills. To facilitate my ability to do this I have taken some time to reflect on how my past work experiences have influenced what I can do. I already had a good handle on delivering this message as related to my time at Pandora, but crafting this for my time at WeWork is still an ongoing process. 

WeWork's story has been in the news for months now, both good and bad; I've had to that in mind throughout the process of integrating my time there into my overall professional message. The most important thing I want to get across when I talk about WeWork to others is that I enjoyed almost every part of my working experience with the company. I liked my team, the work we were doing was challenging and allowed me to grow, I felt able to make an impact, and I wasn't overly bogged down by process. I want others to know that working at WeWork was a positive experience, no matter what others might have read in the news. I look at the experience as a formative part of my career from which I have and can continue to learn a lot.

The first and most important lesson that I can take from my time at WeWork is that I am a developer capable of thriving in dynamic situations. I am able to handle the ambiguity and constant change that comes with reporting to four different direct managers in the course of ten months in stride, continuing to deliver on my promises and make progress towards both professional growth and product development goals. In talking about these capabilities I like to always be able to cite a piece of evidence to support my claims: data drives my decisions as a developer, so I like to be able to provide anyone considering my abilities with some solid data to back my claims. My achievements delivering an Android SDK capable of visualizing WeWork spaces is perfect in this regard since I did so in the most pubilcally-tumultious period in WeWork's life: the weeks and months around the failed IPO. I believe that this is an important skillset for a developer to posess, ignoring distractions and not allowing them to impede forward progress keeps teams productive, leads to greater happiness and job satisfaction in the long run, and helps companies emerge from challenging times stronger than when they entered.

In environments like WeWork I also have identified that approaching news, change, and communications with a healthy skepticism is important. This skepticism enables productivity; it would have been easy for the frequent news articles published across business media to shake 

Manage ambiguity

Trust the tests

Ask "how does this impact me?" and "Do I need to care"

Healthy Skepticism for everything: internal, external

Media coverage & Patience
