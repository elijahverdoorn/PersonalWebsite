On Thursday, May 30th I was laid off from my job at WeWork. I'm not going to lie, initially the news came as a shock. I considered myself to be a productive member of a team deployed to a key project within the company - our project had even been recently highlighted at a monthly all-company meeting to the thousands of WeWork team members! I was on the verge of crossing major milestones towards delivering my work to users, and I was already deep in the planning and research phases of the next steps I could take to bring even more value to subsequent versions of the app. Following the initial jolt of surprise, my feelings became more complicated. I felt and continue to feel somewhat hurt. I care deeply about my work, my co-workers, and the experiences that we were working to enable for our users. It pains me that I won't be able to continue to contribute to supporting the important work of supporting WeWork members, and even more deeply sore for me is the thought that I won't be able to work alongside the team that I had come to know and admire. It truly is one's co-workers who can make or break any working environment; I count myself blessed to have had the opportunity to work alongside some of the most talented, kind, and friendly people I've met in the industry to this point, I am remiss to leave them. Alongside the generic hurt feeling that comes with the unexpected conclusion of any chapter in one's life, I am also experiencing a good amount of disappointment - I had gotten excited about the projects that were coming up and was looking forward to the learning that I would get to do as a part of the work that would go into them.

As I expected, over time these gut reactions diminish and I become more logical about the situation. I find that the most lingering sense that I have is one of trepidation over the uncertainty of the future. I am facing the reality that I'm without a job for the first time since high school: I am blessed to have graduated into a job; during the course of college I held internships, campus jobs, and summer jobs; in high school I did odd jobs and worked at my local library. Intensifying my stress around my situation is, of course, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: it's not a good time to be without a job.

I've been able to temper my reaction to the challenges of this situation thanks in no small part to the amazing support network that I am surrounded with. Essential to this network have been my parents and brothers, each of whom has been there for me in unique and important ways, I can't thank them enough. My peers and team at WeWork have been steadfast in their encouragement, and my wider network continues to play an important part in driving me forward. I'm deeply grateful for everyone who has sent me a message, email, or phone call to voice their support; it means a lot.

So, bolstered by the support of so many wonderful people in my life, the question becomes simple: "What's Next?".

I'm spending a lot of my time asking myself questions about where I see myself at various points in the future: 1, 5, and even 10 years down the line, what do I want to be doing? Where do I want to be? I'm also spending time learning new skills and refreshing old ones. I'm looking forward to having time to dive into topics that I've been interested in but have fallen to the wayside as I've focused on the areas that are most relevant to my occupation. At the moment, these areas include iOS development, game development with Unity, and exploring more improvements I can make to some of the existing projects I've published (shameless plug: [check out my Projects page to learn more!](https://elijahverdoorn.com/projects/)). I'm going to make the most of the unexpected time that I have so I can enter my next role stronger than ever; in order to do that I'm keeping myself accountable to working normal hours, sticking with a routine that supports my overall health and happiness. I'm also leaning on my community more than ever, staying as connected as I can via digital means and asking for help when I know I need it. I'm confident that all these practices will lead to me finding another job to be excited about in short order.
