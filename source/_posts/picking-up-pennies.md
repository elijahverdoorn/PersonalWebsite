According to the step-tracker built into my phone, thus far in 2020 I have walked, on average, 7.16 miles per day. This is, of course, just a rough estimate, but it seems reasonable to me: I walk about 2 miles every morning, and about a mile and a half at night; factoring in the rest of my daily steps around the office, errands, and general activity I can accept 7.16 as a decent estimate. Given the distance, this clearly takes a good chunk of time in my day - I fill this time by consuming _a lot_ of audio entertainment: music, podcasts, and audiobooks are staples in my media diet.

As much as I enjoy each all of the above content (and that's just a small sample!), I find that I sometimes prefer to simply walk in silence, observing the world around me, those that I pass on the street, and listening to the sounds of the city. It is in these moments that I find a great deal of mental clarity, frequently coming up with solutions to longstanding problems, making progress towards my self-reflection goals, and taking general inventory of my life. I encourage any and everyone who is stressed or feeling overwhelmed to try going for a walk, especially if it's not a regular part of your life: you may find the practice helpful.

While the mental benefits remain the primary driver that gets me to lace up my walking shoes every day, I have also found that it saves me a good deal of money: I don't need to pay for a car and the associated parking, fuel, and repair bills, nor do I spend as much on rideshares. In fact, I've probably *made* money by walking: the amount of loose change that I find on the sidewalk is astounding. In the past week alone I've picked up a coin on every walk I've been on. These coins are mostly pennies, so their overall value is small in the grand scheme of my financial life, but nonetheless I enjoy picking them up. On a recent outing, after spotting a dime ahead, I was bending down to claim my bounty when a thought came over me: "What can be learned from picking up this change? There's got to to be a lesson here somewhere!". Being a lover of metaphor and analogy, and always seeking blog post ideas, I quickly found the idea of picking up change to be connected to how I think of making code changes "along the way" to an unrelated goal.
