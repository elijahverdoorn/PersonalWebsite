# Pandora
#### Software Engineering Intern

Summer 2017 afforded me the opportunity to work as an intern at Pandora Media, Inc. on their Android team. Through this opportunity, I gained a deeper understanding of the software engineering process for applications that are targeted to a large audience, more hands-on experience with unit and UI testing, continuous integration techniques, UX design, content management, and big data querying and manipulation. I completed development of an internal prototype feature within the existing Android application and contributed to the development of two different versions of the production software. I also worked for the first time in the Kotlin language, which I found to be a pleasant, effective, and expressive programming language for the Android platform.

# St Olaf College Student Government Association
#### Chief Technology Officer

During the 2016-2017 academic year, I had the honor of being selected to hold the office of Chief Technology Officer of the largest organization on my college campus. I managed a team of engineers to rebuild All About Olaf, a cross-platform mobile application collecting resources for the student population in one convenient location, while maintaining and improving Oleville.com, the college's student hub. I served on the Student Senate, and was a member of the Executive Team, a guiding organization for the student body also tasked with putting on over 150 events each academic year. Through this work I gained leadership skills, management experience, sensitivity for varied student issues, and a deeper appreciation for the strengths of others. I consider this year-long experience to be the most defining aspect of my time at St. Olaf College.

# ProtoLabs
#### Software Development Intern

I had my first professional internship at ProtoLabs, Inc. during the summer of 2016. I spent my time embedded in the Manufacturing Software Team, working to modernize and build out their aging order management system. I learned to operate in an agile development environment, including meeting management, task sizing, time estimation, and prioritization. I had the opportunity to participate in large refactoring and architecture discussions, and led the charge to implement the Model-View-Controller pattern into the application. This change was made more complicated by the fact that large portions of the code base were written in VB Script, which does not provide many tools for implementing modern patterns. I worked diligently to refactor this legacy code into C#, which allows use of the formal Microsoft MVC libraries. During my time at ProtoLabs, I had the privilege of attending their annual developer conference, where I participated in conversation about the latest technologies and how new developments could benefit the business.
