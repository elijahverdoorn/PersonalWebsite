# ProtoLabs

I had my first professional internship at ProtoLabs, Inc. during the summer of 2016. I spent my time embedded in the Manufacturing Software Team, working to modernize and build out their aging order management system. I learned to operate in an agile development environment, including meeting management, task sizing, time estimation, and prioritization. I had the opportunity to participate in large refactoring and architecture discussions, and led the charge to implement the Model-View-Controller pattern into the application. This change was made more complicated by the fact that large portions of the code base were written in VB Script, which does not provide many tools for implementing modern patterns. I worked diligently to refactor this legacy code into C#, which allows use of the formal Microsoft MVC libraries. During my time at ProtoLabs, I had the privilege of attending their annual developer conference, where I participated in conversation about the latest technologies and how new developments could benefit the business.

# Pandora

Summer 2017 afforded me the opportunity to work as an intern at Pandora Media, Inc. on their Android team. This internship is ongoing, more information will be added as a retrospective after it's completion in mid-August.
