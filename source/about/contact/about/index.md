I was born in Madison, WI, although I grew up in Hudson, WI. I became interested in computing from a young age, and distinctly remember sitting on my dad's lap playing games on the family Gateway; that interest evolved in high school to include programming, at the time I didn't realize how big a part of my life it would become. I chose to attend St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN after discovering that their program would allow me to not only study computing more formally, but also to participate in the world-renowned choral music program.

At St. Olaf, I quickly established myself as a leader in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Sciences. During January Term of my Sophomore year I lead a research team working on web visualization of 3D models, culminating in a paper published in the proceedings of the Midwestern instructional computing symposium. The following semester I co-taught a class on Java and Android programming to students ranging from freshmen to seniors focusing on instilling fundamentals of software development, mobile programming, rudimentary database use, and client-server relationships. My junior year focused more heavily on math and the mathematical fundamentals of computing through advanced classes in linear algebra, theory of computation, and machine learning.

Outside of the classroom, I was heavily involved in the Student Government Association where I held an executive level position as the Chief Technology Officer, leading a team of engineers to develop the student website and create a mobile application for student use on campus. I learned a lot in this role about more than just software development, having a voice in major campus decisions through the student senate. My work with student government also taught me a lot about event planning and community management, working to create a more inclusive set of events on campus.

Following my graduation from St. Olaf I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to begin a career in the software industry, working on the Android team at Pandora. Following a successful tenure there, I subsequently worked developing SDKs for WeWork as a member of the Core Platform team. The COVID-19 pandemic caused that opportunity to close; I'm now enjoying working at Robinhood. Additional information about my career path so far can be found on the Experience page of this website.

In my free time I enjoy singing, writing, motorcycling, weight lifting, cooking, playing video games, spending time with family, and walking my two dogs.
