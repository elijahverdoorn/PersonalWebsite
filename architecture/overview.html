                    <p class="text-muted">Given the rapid growth of the industry, and the somewhat unpredictable nature of funding from capital firms, most smaller tech firms have a hard time making deep investments into their offices. Considering most companies that call Silicon Valley home are founded in homes, in garages, or even on college campuses, many of these companies are happy  to have any workspace at all. For the companies that make it out of these initial phases, however, the next steps are not the palace-like offices that are planned for household-name companies like Facebook, Google, and Apple. These companies find themselves working out of older offices, renting space, or repurposing buildings not designed to be offices into office spaces. Luckily for them, Silicon Valley is filled with these spaces. Companies that invest too early in workspace often find themselves going out of business, leaving their workspace on the market for others to try their luck in. Some of these spaces change hands numerous times within a single year, each company spending little time setting themselves up before going out of business, or moving to a different space.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">The thought process that many companies use when thinking about these sorts of investments is drawn from the engineering culture that the founders are used to: any money not invested in the product that will help the company succeed is money wasted. For this reason, many founders still in their initial stages look down on those that spend money on expensive office spaces, amenities like parking ramps, and any non-essential services.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Since many companies do not succeed, many founders begin looking for their ticket out of their current company immediately after starting. This practice contributes to the lower rate of architectural investment, nobody wants to be left with a building and no company to put in it.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">When companies do decide to delve into building their own space, there are two routes that they tend to follow. Some companies look for an easy entry, seeking to build traditional and increase the potential resale value of the building were something to happen to the company; others dive in head first with the mentality of "go big or go home", designing grand structures that emphasizing their power and importance as a leader in their industry. These two mentalities are not mutually exclusive, however, since many companies that have the opportunity to build one office building will have the chance to build more offices in the future, allowing them to start small and have their later buildings express a bit more creativity.
