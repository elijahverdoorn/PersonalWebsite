                    <p class="text-muted">Apple Computers, slightly older than Google, also has grand plans for the future. Their current offices closely resemble Google's: taking ideas from colleges and universities, they have a green space surrounded by buildings, each similar in style. The company's main building is slightly less futuristic in appearance than Google's, which is sensible considering the market that Apple appeals to and the design choices that it is famous for. Despite the similarities that Apple's current physical spaces have to those of their competitor Google, their future plans could not be more different.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Apple has, for one, has already made progress on their new structure: the Apple Campus 2 is set to open in 2017. This circular structure is understandably compared to a spaceship, it's saucer-like shape has another inspiration: the top of the high-end Mac Pro, Apple's flagship desktop computer, has a similar shape. The center of the structure is left open to allow for natural space, Apple officials have said that the goal is to have "80% green space upon completion", a great increase from the 20% on Apple's current campus. The natural space is intended to be a space for employees to escape their work on break periods, to allow for a change of scenery in times of thought or inspiration, and since the fastest way from one side of a circle to the other is through the middle, employees will find themselves in the space more than they intend. This is again similar in function to the college campuses that Apple has modeled their spaces on thus far, since the majority of campuses force people to walk outside to transfer between buildings.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Interestingly, one can point to 60s influences in Apple's design decisions, similar to Google's: there is the clear connection to the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, where the human space station is a curved structure, while the foreboding alien black prism is angular and aggressive. Apple has drawn on this film in the past, notably in their famous Orwellian commercials. Another 60s reference is made by the late Steve Jobs when he stated "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish" in regards to the future of Apple near the end of his life. Many of the major influencers in Apple's development participated in the hippie movements of the 60s, it is fitting then to honor them as Apple continues expanding into their new space.</p>
